# Cassandra Sandbox

This is a simple repo to play with cassandra as a result of watching [Hussein Nassar's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xynXjChKkJc&t=2s)

Part of the code is taken from https://github.com/irtiza07/python-cassandra-demo/blob/main/demo.py with changes to match the [Quickstart](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/quickstart.html) from Cassandra's website
